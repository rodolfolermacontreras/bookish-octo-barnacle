# Problem

Is there a feature or set of features that would yield to a higher home price for the King County Region?

# Abstract

The purpose of this analysis is to provide insights on what home features (if any) could/would yield to higher home prices in the King County Region (Washington, US).
This analysis was done by using the King County House Sales data set containing data from 2014 to 2015.
The data was obtain from the following website:
